anchorlinks
===========

This module creates a new field type that allows users to enter in-page anchor links.

The name and the URL fragment has to be specified. The anchors - where the links point to - has to be manually added to the page, usually in a wysiwyg editor.

You need jquery 1.7 or newer so that the scrolld.js won't throw an error.
